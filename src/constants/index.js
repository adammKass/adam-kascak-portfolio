I also wanted for this website to combine my love for illustrating, so of course simple angular Illustrations were used on the home page. I wanted to keep the color palette black and white, as I also like to work mostly with black and white for most of my illustrations. There are a total of 4 colors used on this website: white, light grey, dark grey and black.\nFonts used are all geometric sans-serif. Circular shapes of Montserrat Alternates complements nicely with sharp edges of illustrations and rectangles on the website. In some places, I also used Futura PT, this time for sharp edges on some of it's symbols, like A and F.\nWebsite was created by me from start to finish, including web development. I used React framework with Tailwind CSS, as this is combination I'm most comfortable with.",
