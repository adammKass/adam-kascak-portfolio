I also wanted this website to combine my love for illustrating, so of course simple angular illustrations were used on the home page. I wanted to keep the color palette black and white, as I also like to work mostly with black and white for most of my illustrations. There are a total of 4 colors used on this website: white, light grey, dark grey, and black.\nFonts used are all geometric sans-serif. Circular shapes of Montserrat Alternates complement nicely with sharp edges of illustrations and rectangles on the website. In some places, I also used Futura PT, this time for sharp edges on some of its symbols, like A and F.\nThe website was created by me from start to finish, including web development. I used the React framework with Tailwind CSS, as this is the combination I'm most comfortable with.",

I did this website after watching Vako Shvili's course on website design. I chose to design a website for showcasing a lot of photos. I chose the underwater photography theme, mostly because water and diving are close to my heart. \nColors chosen were, of course, associated with sea - blues and greens, gradually getting darker scrolling to the bottom, simulating diving in the sea. A simple Noto Sans font was chosen for it's less formal and inviting feel.\nNavbar contains link to a seperate blog, sign up CTA buttons as well as search bar for quick searching of images or photographers. For home banner I had an idea of showcasing image of one of the images on the website, which would change over a period of time. Footer includes more detailed links as well as links to social media.\nPages other than landing page stayed only as wireframe. Some of these pages include Blog main page, Blog post page, Individual image page, Edit user page etc.\nBeautiful underwater photos for the landing page were used from Unsplash.",
