The rounded shapes of Montserrat Alternates complement the sharp elements present in the layout, while Futura PT appears in select sections for its clean geometric structure and distinctive character forms.\nThis website was fully designed and developed by me using React and Tailwind CSS, the framework combination I find most efficient for rapid and scalable development.",

In web design, I move through wireframing, mockup, development to final delivery. In 3D modeling and environment art I move from blockout, high poly to low poly workflow, texturing and optimization. With Illustration I first share with you first sketches and then decide where the illustration should go. Based on that I deliver final illustration. Communication and feedback are part of every step to ensure the result aligns with your vision."
